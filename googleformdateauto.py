#For more google forms, this portion of the code would need to be c&p , knowing the google form in advance.

#Cut import and code line:

#from selenium.webdriver.support.wait import WebDriverWait

#wait = WebDriverWait(driver, 30)

#This wasn't used properly but it tells the browser to wait certain time, it's an implicit wait

#Update march 13 2025 : Chrome Driver is being used locally and small line changes on its use
# gfdauto2.py is the script without any comments, just the code.
